    <h2>Basic Architecture</h2>
    
    <p>The 6502 microprocessor is a relatively simple 8 bit CPU with
    only a few internal registers capable of addressing at most 64Kb
    of memory via its 16 bit address bus. The processor is little
    endian and expects addresses to be stored in memory least significant
    byte first.</p>
    
    <p>The first 256 byte page of memory ($0000-$00FF) is referred
    to as 'Zero Page' and is the focus of a number of special addressing
    modes that result in shorter (and quicker) instructions or allow
    indirect access to the memory. The second page of memory ($0100-$01FF)
    is reserved for the system stack and which cannot be relocated.</p>
    
    <p>The only other reserved locations in the memory map are the
    very last 6 bytes of memory $FFFA to $FFFF which must be programmed
    with the addresses of the non-maskable interrupt handler ($FFFA/B),
    the power on reset location ($FFFC/D) and the BRK/interrupt request
    handler ($FFFE/F) respectively.</p>
    
    <p>The 6502 does not have any special support of hardware devices
    so they must be mapped to regions of memory in order to exchange
    data with the hardware latches.</p>
